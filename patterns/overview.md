# Patterns Directory Overview

This directory contains reusable patterns, implementation guidelines, and common knowledge that applies across multiple parts of the project.

## Directory Purpose
- **Implementation Patterns**: Standardized ways to implement common functionality
- **Reusable Guidelines**: Best practices that apply to multiple features
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Knowledge that spans multiple domains or components

## Pattern Files

### Core Patterns
- `component-patterns.md` - Standard component structure and implementation guidelines
- `api-patterns.md` - API integration and data fetching standards

### Feature-Specific Patterns
(Files created as needed based on project features)

### Development Standards
(Files created as needed based on project requirements)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Read
- **Before implementing new features**: Check for existing patterns that apply to your work
- **When solving common problems**: Look for established solutions before creating new approaches
- **During code reviews**: Reference patterns to ensure consistency

### When to Update
- **New reusable patterns**: Create new pattern files when you solve problems that could apply elsewhere
- **Pattern improvements**: Update existing patterns when better approaches are discovered
- **Cross-feature solutions**: Document solutions that work across multiple features

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for file names
- End with `-patterns.md` for implementation patterns
- End with `-guidelines.md` for process or quality guidelines
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the pattern scope

## Pattern Categories

### Implementation Patterns
Files that show how to implement specific types of functionality
- Code structure and organization
- Common component patterns
- API integration approaches

### Process Guidelines
Files that describe development processes and quality standards
- Testing approaches
- Code review standards
- Performance optimization guidelines

### Best Practices
Files that capture project-specific best practices and lessons learned
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Optimization techniques
- Security considerations

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep this overview updated when adding new files to the patterns directory
- Link related files in the architecture directory when patterns relate to specific architectural domains
- Regularly review and update patterns based on project evolution
- Remove or archive patterns that are no longer relevant
